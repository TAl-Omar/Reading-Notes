## Structure

We see all kinds of documents every day. Newspapers, insurance forms, shop catalogues, and many more.

Web pages act like electronic versions of these documents. For example, you will most likely see the same news or headlines on the web and on the newspapers you can apply for insurance or anything else over the web; and stores have online catalogs.
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.

HTML 5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page. These new elements play an important part in creating layouts.

```
its usage is still subject to change but it is 
already widely being used by web developers
```


###### Traditional HTML Layouts

For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page. 
Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.


###### Headers and footers

The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.


###### Navigation

The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
At the time of writing, some of the developers that were already using HTML5 decided to use the
<nav> element for the links that appear at the bottom of every page.
