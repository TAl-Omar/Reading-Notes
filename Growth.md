# How can you benefit from a growth mindset

I am a person who usually avoid my problems because it gets overwhleming and the growth mindset is a one way to help me to get out of my comfort zone.

## What is a growth mindset?
It is a belief that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through determination and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset comes with a love of learning. This mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue – especially in our work. When we’re growing, we’re more productive.
By contrast, a fixed mindset, would strongly believe that success comes from only who are born talented and a genius, without the need for further development or effort.

### Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset ###
##### * Challenges * ####
The best way too overcome a challenge is to try to face it by taking it step by step, instead of looking at the whole picture.

#### * Obstacles * ####
Your going to face ** alot ** of obstacles, and its normal to want to just watch that tv show, or suddenly paint your whole room when you face any obtacle like a road block. Fixtating on that problem wont solve it, instead, you can take a short break, like starting a new project, or trying a new hobby, meet people, this can help you get some ideas that help you kill that road block.

#### * Critisism * ####
Listening to people's feedback about your work is always a good idea, whther positive or negative. When you get that feedback, you can start on working on to better yourself.
