### Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
##### RGB VALUES
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90).

##### HEX CODES
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80.

##### COLOR NAMES
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan.

##### Understanding Color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

##### Contrast
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

##### CSS3: Opacity opacity, rgba
CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

##### CSS3: HSL Colors
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.


##### CSS3: HSL & HSLA hsl, hsla
The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors.
