###### HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three 
languages that are used to create web pages, where the three languages is kept in separate files with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files. 
Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right builds on the previous one. 

---------------------

##### CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an
HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 


##### LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 

##### THE SOURCE CODE IS NOT AMENDED
If you look at the source code for the example you just created, you will see that the HTML is still exactly the same. 

##### PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).

#### Basic Javascript Instructions

--------------------------
##### Here are some few of the key building blocks of the language and look at how they can be used to write some very basic scripts:

###### STATEMENTS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 


###### COMMENTS
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
